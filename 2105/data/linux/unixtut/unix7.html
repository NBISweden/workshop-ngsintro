<h1>UNIX Tutorial Seven </h1>
<h2>7.1 Compiling UNIX software packages &nbsp; </h2>
<p>We have many public domain and commercial software packages installed on our 
  systems, which are available to all users. However, students are allowed to 
  download and install small software packages in their own home directory, software 
  usually only useful to them personally. </p>
<p>There are a number of steps needed to install the software.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Locate and download the source code (which is usually compressed)</li>
  <li> Unpack the source code</li>
  <li> Compile the code </li>
  <li> Install the resulting executable</li>
  <li> Set paths to the installation directory </li>
</ul>
<p>Of the above steps, probably the most difficult is the compilation stage.</p>

<h3>Compiling Source Code</h3>
<p>All high-level language code must be converted into a form the computer understands. 
  For example, C language source code is converted into a lower-level language 
  called assembly language. The assembly language code made by the previous stage 
  is then converted into object code which are fragments of code which the computer 
  understands directly. The final stage in compiling a program involves linking 
  the object code to code libraries which contain certain built-in functions. 
  This final stage produces an executable program.</p>
<p>To do all these steps by hand is complicated and beyond the capability of the 
  ordinary user. A number of utilities and tools have been developed for programmers 
  and end-users to simplify these steps.</p>
<h3>make and the Makefile</h3>
<p>The <span class="command">make</span> command allows programmers to manage large programs or 
  groups of programs. It aids in developing large programs by keeping track of 
  which portions of the entire program have been changed, compiling only those 
  parts of the program which have changed since the last compile. </p>
<p>The <span class="command">make</span> program gets its set of compile rules from a text file 
  called <strong>Makefile</strong> which resides in the same directory as the 
  source files. It contains information on how to compile the software, e.g. the 
  optimisation level, whether to include debugging info in the executable. It 
  also contains information on where to install the finished compiled binaries 
  (executables), manual pages, data files, dependent library files, configuration 
  files, etc.</p>
<p>Some packages require you to edit the Makefile by hand to set the final installation 
  directory and any other parameters. However, many packages are now being distributed 
  with the GNU configure utility.</p>
<h3>configure</h3>
<p>As the number of UNIX variants increased, it became harder to write programs 
  which could run on all variants. Developers frequently did not have access to 
  every system, and the characteristics of some systems changed from version to 
  version. The GNU configure and build system simplifies the building of programs 
  distributed as source code. All programs are built using a simple, standardised, 
  two step process. The program builder need not install any special tools in 
  order to build the program. </p>
<p>The <span class="command">configure</span> shell script attempts to guess correct values for 
  various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses those values 
  to create a <strong>Makefile</strong> in each directory of the package. </p>
<p>The simplest way to compile a package is:</p>

  
<ol>
  <li> <span class="command">cd</span> to the directory containing the package's source code.<br />
  </li>
  <li> Type <span class="command">./configure</span> to configure the package for your system.<br />
  </li>
  <li> Type <span class="command">make</span> to compile the package.<br />
  </li>
  <li> Optionally, type <span class="command">make check</span> to run any self-tests that come 
    with the package.<br />
  </li>
  <li> Type <span class="command">make install</span> to install the programs and any data files 
    and documentation.<br />
  </li>
  <li> Optionally, type <span class="command">make clean</span> to remove the program binaries 
    and object files from the source code directory&nbsp; <br />
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The configure utility supports a wide variety of options. You can usually use 
  the <b>--help</b> option to get a list of interesting options for a particular 
  configure script. </p>
  
<p>The only generic options you are likely to use are the<b> --prefix</b>  
  and <b>--exec-prefix</b> options. These options are used to specify the 
  installation directories. &nbsp; </p>
<p>The directory named by the <b>--prefix</b> option will hold machine independent 
  files such as documentation, data and configuration files. </p>
<p>The directory named by the <b>--exec-prefix</b> option, (which is normally 
  a subdirectory of the <b>--prefix</b> directory), will hold machine dependent files 
  such as executables. </p>

<h2>7.2 Downloading source code</h2>
<p>For this example, we will download a piece of free software that converts between 
  different units of measurements. </p>
<p>First create a download directory&nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli"> % mkdir download </p>
<p><a href="units-1.74.tar.gz">Download the software here</a> and 
  save it to your new download directory.</p>
<h2>7.3 Extracting the source code &nbsp; </h2>
<p>Go into your <strong>download</strong> directory and list the contents.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="cli"> % cd download <br />
  % ls -l </p>
<p>As you can see, the filename ends in tar.gz. The tar command turns 
  several files and directories into one single tar file. This is then compressed 
  using the gzip command (to create a tar.gz file). </p>
<p>First unzip the file using the gunzip command. This will create 
  a .tar file.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli"> % gunzip units-1.74.tar.gz </p>
<p>Then extract the contents of the tar file. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli">% tar -xvf units-1.74.tar </p>
<p>Again, list the contents of the <strong>download</strong> directory, then go 
  to the <strong>units-1.74</strong> sub-directory.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli">% cd units-1.74 </p>
<h2>7.4 Configuring and creating the Makefile &nbsp; </h2>
<p>The first thing to do is carefully read the <strong>README</strong> and <strong>INSTALL</strong> 
  text files (use the less command). These contain important information 
  on how to compile and run the software.</p>
<p>The units package uses the GNU configure system to compile the source code. 
  We will need to specify the installation directory, since the default will be 
  the main system area which you will not have write permissions for. We need 
  to create an install directory in your home directory. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli">% mkdir ~/units174</p>
<p>Then run the configure utility setting the installation path to this.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="cli">% ./configure --prefix=$HOME/units174</p>
<p class="hint">NOTE: 
  The <strong>$HOME</strong> variable is an example of an environment variable. 
  
  The value of <strong>$HOME</strong> is the path to your home directory. Just 
  type <br />
  <br />
  <span class="command">% echo $HOME </span><br />
  <br />
  to show the contents of this variable. We will learn more about environment 
  variables in a later chapter.</p>
<p>If <span class="command">configure</span> has run correctly, it will have created a Makefile with all necessary 
  options. You can view the Makefile if you wish (use the <span class="command">less</span> command), 
  but do not edit the contents of this. </p>
<h2>7.5 Building the package&nbsp; </h2>
<p>Now you can go ahead and build the package by running the make 
  command.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli">% make</p>
<p>After a minute or two (depending on the speed of the computer), the executables 
  will be created. You can check to see everything compiled successfully by typing</p>
<p class="cli">% make check</p>
<p> If everything is okay, you can now install the package. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli">% make install</p>
<p>This will install the files into the <strong>~/units174</strong> directory 
  you created earlier.</p>
<h2>7.6 Running the software</h2>
<p>You are now ready to run the software (assuming everything worked).&nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli">% cd ~/units174</p>
<p>If you list the contents of the units directory, you will see a number of subdirectories.</p>
<table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#666666">
  <tr> 
    <td>bin</td>
    <td>The binary executables</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>info</td>
    <td>GNU info formatted documentation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>man</td>
    <td>Man pages</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>share</td>
    <td>Shared data files</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>To run the program, change to the <strong>bin</strong> directory and type&nbsp;</p>
<p class="cli">% ./units </p>
<p>As an example, convert 6 feet to metres.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli">You have: 6 feet<br />
  You want: metres&nbsp; </p>
<p class="output">* 1.8288 </p>
<p>If you get the answer 1.8288, congratulations, it worked.</p>
<p>To view what units it can convert between, view the data file in the share 
  directory (the list is quite comprehensive).</p>
<p>To read the full documentation, change into the <strong>info</strong> directory 
  and type&nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli">% info --file=units.info</p>
<h2>7.7 Stripping unnecessary code</h2>
<p>When a piece of software is being developed, it is useful for the programmer 
  to include debugging information into the resulting executable. This way, if 
  there are problems encountered when running the executable, the programmer can 
  load the executable into a debugging software package and track down any software 
  bugs.</p>
<p>This is useful for the programmer, but unnecessary for the user. We can assume 
  that the package, once finished and available for download has already been 
  tested and debugged. However, when we compiled the software above, debugging 
  information was still compiled into the final executable. Since it is unlikey 
  that we are going to need this debugging information, we can strip it out of 
  the final executable. One of the advantages of this is a much smaller executable, 
  which should run slightly faster.</p>
<p>What we are going to do is look at the before and after size of the binary 
  file. First change into the <strong>bin</strong> directory of the units installation 
  directory.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli">% cd ~/units174/bin<br />
  % ls -l </p>
<p>As you can see, the file is over 100 kbytes in size. You can get more information 
  on the type of file by using the file command.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli">% file units</p>
<p class="output">units: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1, dynamically 
  linked (uses shared libs), not stripped</p>
<p>To strip all the debug and line numbering information out of the binary file, 
  use the strip command&nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli">% strip units<br />
  % ls -l </p>
<p>As you can see, the file is now 36 kbytes - a third of its original size. Two 
  thirds of the binary file was debug code!!!</p>
<p>Check the file information again.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="cli">% file units</p>
<p class="output">units: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1, dynamically 
  linked (uses shared libs), stripped</p>
<p>Sometimes you can use the <span class="command">make</span> command to install pre-stripped copies 
  of all the binary files when you install the package. 
  
  Instead of typing <span class="command">make install</span>, simply type <span class="command">make install-strip</span></p>
