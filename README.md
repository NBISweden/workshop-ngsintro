# workshop-ngsintro [![gh-actions-build-status](https://github.com/nbisweden/workshop-ngsintro/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nbisweden/workshop-ngsintro/actions?workflow=build)

This repo contains the course material for NBIS workshop **Introduction to Bioinformatics using NGS data**. The rendered view of this repo is available [here](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-ngsintro/).

## Repo organisation

The source material is located on the *master* branch (default). The rendered material is located on the *gh-pages* branch. For most part, one only needs to update content in master. Changes pushed to the *master* branch is automatically rendered to the *gh-pages* branch.

The first build can take around 30-40 mins depending on the number of R packages. Subsequent builds take about 2 minutes since caching is enabled. Caches are removed after 7 days of last access. A push after that will require a full rebuild.

## Rendering

The website is automatically rendered by [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) whenever a change is pushed. **DO NOT** push any rendered material such as `slide_topic.html`, `lab_topic.html` or supporting directories `slide_topic_files`, `lab_topic_files` etc to GitHub.

For local rendering, you need R installed on your system along with dependency packages listed under *packages_cran_repo* and *packages_bioc_repo* in `_site.yml`. Steps below are run in R.

Run `rmarkdown::render_site()` in the project directory. This renders all .Rmd and .md files to generate the HTML files and all other necessary files (including the assets, images and data directories) and moves them all into a directory specified under `output_dir` in **`_site.yml`**. Open `output_dir/index.html` to start. Remove this directory after use. **DO NOT** commit and push this output directory to GitHub.

You can also run `rmarkdown::render("bla.Rmd")` on individual .Rmd/.md files. This is a time-saver as the whole website need not be rendered just to preview this one file.

**Known issue**: Note that when rendering **slide** Rmd files locally using `render()`, it takes output and formatting from `_site.yml` when it should use it's own definition from YAML. For now, either use `render_site()` or rename the `_site.yml` temporarily.
