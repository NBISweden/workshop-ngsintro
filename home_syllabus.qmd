## Learning outcomes

After this workshop you should be able to:

- Describe the basic principles of next generation sequencing.
- Use the Linux command line interface to manage simple file processing operations, and organise directory structures.
- Connect to and work on a remote compute cluster.
- Apply programs in Linux for analysis of NGS data.
- Summarise the applications of current NGS technologies, including the weakness and strengths of the approaches and when it is appropriate to use which one of them.
- Explain common NGS file formats.
- Interpret quality control of NGS reads.
- Explain the steps involved in variant calling using whole genome sequencing data.
- Independently perform a basic variant calling workflow on example data.
- Explain the steps involved in a differential gene expression workflow using RNA seq data.
- Hands-on experience with handling of raw RNA sequencing data, QC and quantification of gene expression.
- Conceptual understanding of differential gene expression analysis.
