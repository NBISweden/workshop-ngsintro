<h1>UNIX Tutorial Five </h1>
<h2>5.1 File system security (access rights) </h2>
<p>In your <b>unixstuff</b> directory, type </p>

<p class="cli"> % ls -l (l for long listing!)</p>
<p>You will see that you now get lots of details about the contents of your directory, 
  similar to the example below. </p>
<p> <img src="file1.gif" alt="File and directory access rights" /> </p>
<p>Each file (and directory) has associated access rights, which may be found 
  by typing <span class="command">ls -l</span>. Also, <span class="command">ls -lg</span> gives additional information 
  as to which group owns the file (beng95 in the following example): </p>
<p class="output"> -rwxrw-r-- 1 ee51ab beng95 
  2450 Sept29 11:52 file1</p>
<p>In the left-hand column is a 10 symbol string consisting of the symbols d, 
  r, w, x, -, and, occasionally, s or S. If d is present, it will be at the left 
  hand end of the string, and indicates a directory: otherwise - will be the starting 
  symbol of the string. </p>
<p>The 9 remaining symbols indicate the permissions, or access rights, and are 
  taken as three groups of 3. </p>
<ul>
  <li> The left group of 3 gives the file permissions for the user that owns the 
    file (or directory) (ee51ab in the above example); <br />
  </li>
  <li> the middle group gives the permissions for the group of people to whom 
    the file (or directory) belongs (eebeng95 in the above example);<br />
  </li>
  <li> the rightmost group gives the permissions for all others.</li>
</ul>

<p>The symbols r, w, etc., have slightly different meanings depending on whether 
  they refer to a simple file or to a directory. </p>
<h3>Access rights on files.</h3>
<ul>
  <li> r (or -), indicates read permission (or otherwise), that is, the presence 
    or absence of permission to read and copy the file <br />
  </li>
  <li> w (or -), indicates write permission (or otherwise), that is, the permission 
    (or otherwise) to change a file <br />
  </li>
  <li> x (or -), indicates execution permission (or otherwise), that is, the permission 
    to execute a file, where appropriate </li>
</ul>
<h3>Access rights on directories.</h3>
<ul>
  <li> r allows users to list files in the directory; </li>
  <li> w means that users may delete files from the directory or move files into 
    it; </li>
  <li> x means the right to access files in the directory. This implies that you 
    may read files in the directory provided you have read permission on the individual 
    files. </li>
</ul>
<p>So, in order to read a file, you must have execute permission on the directory 
  containing that file, and hence on any directory containing that directory as 
  a subdirectory, and so on, up the tree. </p>
<h3>Some examples</h3>

<table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#666666">
  <tr>
    <td>-rwxrwxrwx</td>
    <td>a file that everyone can read, write and execute (and delete).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-rw-------</td>
    <td>a file that only the owner can read and write - no-one else <br />
      can read or write and no-one has execution rights (e.g. your <br />
      mailbox file).</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h2>5.2 Changing access rights</h2>
<h3>chmod (changing a file mode)</h3>
<p>Only the owner of a file can use chmod to change the permissions 
  of a file. The options of chmod are as follows </p>
<table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#666666">
  <tr> 
    <th>Symbol</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><div align="center">u</div></td>
    <td>user</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><div align="center">g</div></td>
    <td>group</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><div align="center">o</div></td>
    <td>other</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><div align="center">a</div></td>
    <td>all</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><div align="center">r</div></td>
    <td>read</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><div align="center">w</div></td>
    <td>write (and delete)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><div align="center">x</div></td>
    <td>execute (and access directory) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><div align="center">+</div></td>
    <td>add permission</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><div align="center">-</div></td>
    <td>take away permission</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> For example, to remove read write and execute permissions on the file <strong>biglist</strong> 
  for the group and others, type </p>

<p class="cli"> % chmod go-rwx biglist </p>
<p>This will leave the other permissions unaffected. </p>

<p>To give read and write permissions on the file <strong>biglist</strong> to 
  all, </p>
<p class="cli"> % chmod a+rw biglist </p>
<h3>Exercise 5a</h3>
<p>Try changing access permissions on the file <strong>science.txt</strong> and 
  on the directory <strong>backups</strong></p>
<p> Use <span class="command">ls -l</span> to check that the permissions have changed. </p>

<h2>5.3 Processes and Jobs  </h2>
<p>A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier). 
  To see information about your processes, with their associated PID and status, 
  type </p>

<p class="cli"> % ps </p>
<p>A process may be in the foreground, in the background, or be suspended. In 
  general the shell does not return the UNIX prompt until the current process 
  has finished executing. </p>
<p> Some processes take a long time to run and hold up the terminal. Backgrounding 
  a long process has the effect that the UNIX prompt is returned immediately, 
  and other tasks can be carried out while the original process continues executing.</p>
<h3>Running background processes</h3>
<p>To background a process, type an <strong>&amp;</strong> at the end of the command 
  line. For example, the command <span class="command">sleep</span> waits a given number of seconds 
  before continuing. Type </p>
<p class="cli"> % sleep 10 </p>
<p>This will wait 10 seconds before returning the command prompt %. Until the 
  command prompt is returned, you can do nothing except wait. </p>
<p> To run sleep in the background, type </p>
<p class="cli"> % sleep 10 &amp;</p>
<p class="output">[1] 6259 </p>
<p>The <strong>&amp;</strong> runs the job in the background and returns the prompt 
  straight away, allowing you do run other programs while waiting for that one 
  to finish. </p>
<p>The first line in the above example is typed in by the user; the next line, 
  indicating job number and PID, is returned by the machine. The user is be notified 
  of a job number (numbered from 1) enclosed in square brackets, together with 
  a PID and is notified when a background process is finished. Backgrounding is 
  useful for jobs which will take a long time to complete. </p>
<h3>Backgrounding a current foreground process</h3>
<p>At the prompt, type </p>
<p class="cli"> % sleep 1000 </p>
<p>You can suspend the process running in the foreground by typing <b>^Z</b>, i.e.hold down the [<b>Ctrl</b>] 
  key and type [<b>z</b>]. Then to put 
  it in the background, type </p>
<p class="cli"> % bg </p>
<p class="hint">Note: do not background programs that require user interaction 
  e.g. vi </p>

<h2>5.4 Listing suspended and background processes </h2>
<p>When a process is running, backgrounded or suspended, it will be entered onto 
  a list along with a job number. To examine this list, type </p>
<p class="cli"> % jobs </p>
<p>An example of a job list could be </p>
<p class="output"> [1] Suspended sleep 1000<br />
  [2] Running netscape<br />
  [3] Running matlab </p>
<p>To restart (foreground) a suspended processes, type </p>
<p class="cli"> % fg %<i>jobnumber</i> </p>
<p>For example, to restart sleep 1000, type </p>
<p class="cli"> % fg %1 </p>
<p>Typing <span class="command">fg</span> with no job number foregrounds the last suspended process.</p>
  <p> </p>
<h2>5.5 Killing a process </h2>
<h3>kill (terminate or signal a process)</h3>
<p>It is sometimes necessary to kill a process (for example, when an executing 
  program is in an infinite loop) </p>
<p> To kill a job running in the foreground, type <b>^C</b> (control c). 
  For example, run </p>
<p class="cli">% sleep 100<br />
  ^C </p>
<p> To kill a suspended or background process, type </p>
<p class="cli"> % kill %<i>jobnumber</i> </p>
<p>For example, run </p>
<p class="cli">% sleep 100 &amp;<br />
  % jobs</p>
<p> If it is job number 4, type </p>
<p class="cli"> % kill %4 </p>
<p>To check whether this has worked, examine the job list again to see if the 
  process has been removed. </p>
<h3>ps (process status)</h3>
<p> Alternatively, processes can be killed by finding their process numbers (PIDs) 
  and using kill <var>PID_number</var></p>
<p class="cli"> % sleep 1000 &amp;<br />
  % ps</p>
<p class="output">PID TT S TIME COMMAND<br />
  20077 pts/5 S 0:05 sleep 1000<br />
  21563 pts/5 T 0:00 netscape<br />
  21873 pts/5 S 0:25 nedit </p>
<p>To kill off the process <b>sleep 1000</b>, type </p>
<p class="cli"> % kill 20077 </p>
<p>and then type <span class="command">ps</span> again to see if it has been removed from the 
  list. </p>
<p> If a process refuses to be killed, uses the <strong>-9</strong> option, i.e. 
  type </p>
<p class="cli"> % kill -9 20077 </p>
<p class="hint">Note: It is not possible to kill off other users' processes !!!</p>
