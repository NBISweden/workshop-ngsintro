  <h1>UNIX Introduction </h1>
  <h2>What is UNIX? </h2>
  <p><img src="media/unix-plate2.jpg" alt="UNIX&reg; License Plate" width="189" height="114" border="0" align="right" />UNIX is an  operating system which was first developed in the 1960s, and has been under constant development ever since. By operating
  system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. It is a stable, multi-user, multi-tasking system for servers, desktops and laptops. </p>
  <p> UNIX systems also have a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to Microsoft Windows which provides an easy to use environment. However, knowledge of UNIX is required for operations
  which aren't covered by a graphical program, or for when there is no  windows
  interface available, for example, in a telnet session.</p>
  <h2>Types of UNIX</h2>
  <p><img src="media/linux-penguin-small.png" alt="The Linux Penguin" width="80" height="96" hspace="8" align="right" />There are many different versions of UNIX, although they share common similarities. The  most popular varieties of UNIX are  Sun Solaris,  GNU/Linux, and MacOS X. </p>
  <p>Here in the School, we use  Solaris on our servers and workstations, and Fedora  Linux on the servers and desktop PCs.</p>
  <h2>The UNIX operating system </h2>
<p>The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts; the kernel, the shell
  and the programs. </p>
<h3>The kernel </h3>
<p>The kernel of UNIX is the hub of the operating system: it allocates time and
  memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in response
  to system calls. </p>
<p> As an illustration of the way that the shell and the kernel work together,
  suppose a user types <span class="command">rm myfile</span> (which has the effect of removing
  the file <strong>myfile</strong>). The shell searches the filestore for the
  file containing the program <span class="command">rm</span>, and then requests the kernel, through
  system calls, to execute the program <span class="command">rm</span> on <b>myfile</b>. When the process
  <span class="command">rm myfile</span> has finished running, the shell then returns the UNIX
  prompt % to the user, indicating that it is waiting for further commands. </p>
<h3>The shell</h3>
<p>The shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. When a user
  logs in, the login program checks the username and password, and then starts
  another program called the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter (CLI).
  It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried
  out. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate, the shell gives
  the user another prompt (% on our systems). </p>
<p> The adept user can customise his/her own shell, and users can use different
  shells on the same machine. Staff and students in the school have the <b>tcsh shell</b>  by default. </p>
<p> The tcsh shell has certain features to help the user inputting commands.</p>
<p> Filename Completion - By typing part of the name of a command, filename or
  directory and pressing the [<b>Tab</b>] key, the tcsh shell will complete the rest
  of the name automatically. If the shell finds more than one name beginning with
  those letters you have typed, it will beep, prompting you to type a few more
  letters before pressing the tab key again. </p>
<p> History - The shell keeps a list of the commands you have typed in. If you
  need to repeat a command, use the cursor keys to scroll up and down the list
  or type history for a list of previous commands. </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Files and processes </h2>
<p>Everything in UNIX is either a file or a process. </p>
<p> A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier).
</p>
<p> A file is a collection of data. They are created by users using text editors,
  running compilers etc. </p>
<p> Examples of files: </p>
<ul>
  <li> a document (report, essay etc.) </li>
  <li> the text of a program written in some high-level programming language </li>
  <li> instructions comprehensible directly to the machine and incomprehensible
    to a casual user, for example, a collection of binary digits (an executable
    or binary file); </li>
  <li> a directory, containing information about its contents, which may be a
    mixture of other directories (subdirectories) and ordinary files. </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h2>The Directory Structure </h2>
<p>All the files are grouped together in the directory structure. The file-system
  is arranged in a hierarchical structure, like an inverted tree. The top of the
  hierarchy is traditionally called <strong>root</strong> (written as a slash / ) </p>
<p align="center"><img src="media/unix-tree.png" alt="Unix File Structure" width="560" height="316" /></p>
<p> In the diagram above, we see that the home directory of the undergraduate student <b>&quot;ee51vn&quot;</b> contains two sub-directories (<b>docs</b> and <b>pics</b>) and a file called <b>report.doc</b>. </p>
<p>The full path to the file <b>report.doc</b> is <b>&quot;/home/its/ug1/ee51vn/report.doc&quot; </b></p>
<h2>Starting an UNIX terminal </h2>
<p>To open an UNIX terminal window, click on the &quot;Terminal&quot; icon from Applications/Accessories menus.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="media/gnome-window.gif" alt="Gnome Menus" width="518" height="396" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> An UNIX Terminal window will then appear with a  % prompt, waiting for
  you to start entering commands.</p>
<p>
    <span style="color:red">
        <b>NOTE:</b>
        Terminals can have many different appearances, which can be confusing in the beginning.
        The thing all the appearances have in common is that they have 'strange character' as indicator of the line where you type stuff.
        In this exercises they use the percent character, %, and in the terminal emulator they have chosen the brackets character, # .
        Most commonly used is the dollar character, $ .
    </span>
