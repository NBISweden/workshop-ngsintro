## Summary

Below is a summary of The NBIS Code of Conduct. Continue reading for a more detailed description of the CoC.

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by NBIS Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form of behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to the NBIS Training coordinator (education[@]nbis.se), who will take the appropriate action to address the situation.

## Detailed
### Part 1. Introduction

Training is one of the core values of NBIS, and benefits from the contributions of the entire scientific community. We value the involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in NBIS/ELIXIR courses is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by NBIS including, but not limited to courses, email lists, and online forums such as Studium, GitHub, Slack, Twitter and LinkedIn. Course organizers and teachers are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

The NBIS Training Coordinator is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. It can be contacted by emailing education[@]nbis.se. All reports will be reviewed and will be kept confidential.

### Part 2. The NBIS Code of Conduct

NBIS is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Everyone who participates in NBIS training activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by NBIS including, but not limited to, courses, email lists, and online forums such as Studium, GitHub, Slack, Twitter and LinkedIN. Course leaders and teachers are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. By participating, attendants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which NBIS resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information.

#### Part 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any NBIS events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organisers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or engage with the NBIS Training Coordinator or the appropriate authorities to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.
