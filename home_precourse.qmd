You will have to have 2 different accounts to complete the labs in this course. The first one is in [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se/) which is the portal that handles all your user accounts at NAISS compute centers (umbrella organisation for the academic high-performance centers).  The other one is at the compute center [PDC](https://www.pdc.kth.se/) in Stockholm.

## SUPR

A SUPR/NAISS account is needed to create the account for the computers we will be using during the course. SUPR is also the system that you will handle your own projects in if you want to use this kind of resources in your research after the course.

If you do not already have one, create an account at [SUPR/NAISS](https://supr.naiss.se). Then, Log in to [SUPR/NAISS](https://supr.naiss.se/), preferably using the SWAMID (requires that you are within Swedish academia).

![](assets/images/precourse/supr-login.webp){width="70%"}

Before proceeding with applying for project membership and user account, we have to accept the NAISS User Agreement. Do this by clicking the [Personal Information](https://supr.naiss.se/person/) link in the left sidebar menu. The scroll down a bit until you reach the section **User Agreements**. If you already have accepted it the State will be a green box with the text Accepted in it. If it is anything else, click it to start the accepting process.

::: {.callout-tip}
This is where you might run into trouble if you don't have a SWAMID connected account. You will not be able to accept the user agreement online without it, so you will have to send in your acceptance in paper form together with a copy of your passport. This process can take a week or more, so please make sure you can accept the user agreement in good time.

## PDC

The computing cluster Dardel at PDC will be use during the course. After making sure you have an accepted user agreement, go to the [**SUPR/NAISS Projects**](https://supr.naiss.se/project/) page and request membership to the project ID: [**{{< meta id_project >}}**]{.badge}

![](assets/images/precourse/supr-request.webp){width="70%"}

Once you are accepted to a project, you should see that project listed under your active projects.

![](assets/images/precourse/supr-projects.webp){width="70%"}


Finally you need to request a login account to PDC. This will be the account you use to log in to the actual computers, so it is not the same as your SUPR account. Login to SUPR and go to the [Accounts page](https://supr.naiss.se/account/). Under the **Possible Resource Account Requests** heading click on **Request Account at PDC** button and confirm it on the next page. If it is missing from this page, it could be because you already have a login account created (only 1 account per person allowed), or that you have not yet gotten your project memberships approved.

Checking your request and approving your account requires some manual work, so you might have to wait for some time (up to a couple of working days) before the next step. When the account is ready to be created, you will receive an email to your registered email address (shown in your SUPR contact information) with information about your account. Follow the instructions you get from them to complete your account creation. The morning session on the Monday of the course will cover [how to connect to PDC](topics/other/lab_connect_pdc.qmd), a bunch of steps that might not be trivial for novice users.


## Install tools

### Zoom

[![](assets/images/precourse/zoom.webp){.precourse-tool}](https://www.zoom.com) [{{< fa brands ubuntu >}} {{< fa brands apple >}} {{< fa brands windows >}}]{.badge} We will use Zoom for online courses and troubleshooting. Please download and install the latest version for your OS.

### ThinLinc 

[![](assets/images/precourse/thinlinc.webp){.precourse-tool}](https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/download) [{{< fa brands ubuntu >}} {{< fa brands apple >}} {{< fa brands windows >}}]{.badge} ThinLinc allows graphical connection to a remote cluster. This means you can work on a cluster graphically like you would on a local computer. This is accessible through the browser or an installed application. The installed version has a few more features than using the browser version. Download and install from [https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/download](https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/download).

### X11

![](assets/images/precourse/xquartz.webp){.precourse-tool}  

X11 is required to open graphical programs from a terminal.

##### Mac
[{{< fa brands apple >}}]{.badge} Mac users will need to download and install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) if not already installed. You can check if it's installed by running `which Xquartz` in the terminal.

##### Windows
[{{< fa brands windows >}}]{.badge} Windows users are recommended to install [VcXsrv](https://github.com/marchaesen/vcxsrv/releases) to open graphical programs from PowerShell. This approach should work even if you don't have administrator permissions on your computer. Download the latest release (named something like `vcxsrv-64.XX.YY.ZZ.installer.noadmin.exe`) and install it. Once it is installed you can start the program from the desktop shortcut and it will run in the background and handle any graphics that arrives through PowerShell. [More detailed install instructions here if needed](home_precourse_supplementary.qmd#windows-and-x11).

Another alternative for Windows users is [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net), i.e. don't install MobaXterm if you managed to get VcXsrv in the previous paragraph installed. It is a all-in-one terminal solution that contains its own X11 server. It has a terminal, opens X11 windows and allows browsing remote files graphically through SFTP. It is recommended that you INSTALL the program and not use the portable version. The downside is that it has some non-standard keyboard shortcuts from things like copy/paste etc.

### IGV 

[![](assets/images/precourse/igv.webp){.precourse-tool}](https://igv.org/doc/desktop/) [{{< fa brands ubuntu >}} {{< fa brands apple >}} {{< fa brands windows >}}]{.badge} Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is useful in inspecting genomic data in BAM files. IGV is available on the cluster, but it might be very slow over X11. IGV is also available through ThinLinc but it depends on the reliability of ThinLinc and the network connection. Having a local installation of IGV gives you the freedom to download the BAM files and inspect them locally.

### Filezilla^\*^

[![](assets/images/precourse/filezilla.webp){.precourse-tool}](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1) [{{< fa brands ubuntu >}} {{< fa brands apple >}} {{< fa brands windows >}}]{.badge} When you need to transfer data between the remote cluster and your computer, you can use the tools SCP or SFTP through the terminal. If you prefer a GUI to upload and download files from the remote cluster, we recommend installing [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1). For Windows users, if you have installed MobaXterm, it already has an SFTP file browser.

^\*^ Optional

### Eduroam

::: {.callout-note}
This is is only relevant for on-site courses.
:::

[![](assets/images/precourse/eduroam.webp){.precourse-tool}](https://eduroam.org/) [{{< fa brands ubuntu >}} {{< fa brands apple >}} {{< fa brands windows >}}]{.badge} Please make sure you have a working [Eduroam](https://eduroam.org/) wifi connection setup before the course, since we will only have wifi internet access in the computer room where we have the course. The instructions on how to get it working could differ university to university, so please refer to you home university's instructions on how to do that. Try searching for "eduroam" and your home university, e.g. `eduroam uppsala university`, to find it.

::: {.callout-tip}
If you want to get a primer on using the terminal, you can get started with the following **Tutorial One** at this link [Unix tutorial for beginners](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-ngsintro-extras/unixtut/). You can use [https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-ngsintro-extras/emu/](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-ngsintro-extras/emu/) to try the commands in the tutorial, so that you don't mess up any real world system. If you have any questions regarding this tutorial contact: *martin.dahlo [at] nbis.se*.
